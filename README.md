# Modeling-Suicidal-Ideation-Growth-Trajectory-An-Application-of-a-Growth-Mixture-Model-to-Add-Health
The objective of the study is to quantify longitudinal trajectories of groups (classes) of past-year suicide ideation and to explore the association between covariates and class membership in these trajectories from adolescence into young adulthood. In the study, the heterogeneity of longitudinal trajectories of suicide ideation groups of individuals will be identified. In addition, the relationship between covariates and each latent class will be estimated. Primary research areas include identifying the number of classes and longitudinal group differences of suicide-related thought and behavior.
